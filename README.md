# Glutyfree MLKit Adoption

This is a fork of [bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin) which is used by the app [Glutyfree](http://glutyfree.me)

To reduce the file size, especially for ios (see this open [issue](https://github.com/bharat-biradar/Google-Ml-Kit-plugin/issues/26)), this fork only provides the necessary parts of MLKit to Glutyfree which are:
- [text identification (OCR)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/recognize-text)
- [language identification](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/identify-languages)
